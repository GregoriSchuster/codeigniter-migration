Migrations are a fantastic way to manage database schema changes across multiple development environments, as well as provide a way to roll back poorly executed schema changes without having to manually run MySQL table alters, creations, etc. Database migrations also provide a simple way to spin up new development servers that can run a local database while ensuring all development databases are in sync.
